# CS4110: HW/SW Co-Design of Embedded Systems Project


## Introduction
This repository has been made as a part of the final project assignment of USN course CS4110 by ***Group3***
**Arnaf Aziz Torongo, Kamrul Hasan, Md. Muzibur Rahman and S M Habibul Mursaleen Chowdhury**.

Hardware, Software, and Vitis HLS implementation of two stream ciphers Porta table cipher and Autoclave cipher has been considered.

There are two folders in this repository. Each one contains all three (Hardware, Software, and Vitis HLS) implementation on three different folders, and each implementation contains its own **readme.md**. All the steps to recreate the implementations have been mentioned in the readme file.

Additionally, there is an image folder for each cipher that contains the image of FSMD and ASMD chart for hardware implementation. 

Finally, a comprehensive paper is included that contains the dicussion of the implementations of these ciphers.
